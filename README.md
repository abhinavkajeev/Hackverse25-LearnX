LearnX ðŸ“šâœ¨ - 
      Decentralized Learning Reinvented | Powered by Edu-Chain & Gemini AI

ðŸ§ About LearnX
LearnX is a decentralized, AI-driven learning platform that redefines how mentorship and education work in the Web3 era. Mentors can upload, manage, and sell their courses while retaining full ownership. Students, in turn, are rewarded for learning â€” they earn tokens or NFTs for each section they complete, making education engaging and incentivized. The platform also integrates an AI chat assistant powered by Gemini to resolve doubts instantly.

Key Features:

(i) Token/NFT rewards for every course section completed

(ii) AI doubt assistant integrated inside each course (Gemini AI)

(iii)Seamless front-end built with ReactJS

ðŸŒŸ Vision of LearnX
Our vision is to democratize education by:

(i) Giving mentors full control and ownership of their content

(ii) Rewarding students for active participation and learning

(iii) Removing intermediaries from the learning ecosystem

(iv) Integrating cutting-edge AI tools to personalize and assist the learning process

(v) Creating a transparent, decentralized, and incentivized education model accessible to all
