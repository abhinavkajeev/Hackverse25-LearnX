ðŸ§  About LearnX
LearnX is a decentralized, AI-driven learning platform that redefines how mentorship and education work in the Web3 era. Mentors can upload, manage, and sell their courses while retaining full ownership. Students, in turn, are rewarded for learning â€” they earn tokens or NFTs for each section they complete, making education engaging and incentivized. The platform also integrates an AI chat assistant powered by Gemini to resolve doubts instantly.

Key Features:

Token/NFT rewards for every course section completed

AI doubt assistant integrated inside each course (Gemini AI)

Seamless front-end built with ReactJS

ðŸŒŸ Vision of LearnX
Our vision is to democratize education by:

Giving mentors full control and ownership of their content

Rewarding students for active participation and learning

Removing intermediaries from the learning ecosystem

Integrating cutting-edge AI tools to personalize and assist the learning process

Creating a transparent, decentralized, and incentivized education model accessible to all
